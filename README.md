# Diagnosing Breast Cancer through Machine Learning
Utilizing predictive classifiers to diagnose a malignant breast tumor based on data from fine needle aspiration 

This project aims to develop a new method for the diagnosis of malignant breast cancer, by applying machine learning algorithms to data sets from fine needle aspirates. The effectiveness will be measured by its success rate, in differentiating malignant from benign tumors.

The dataset, specifically the “Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set” is computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image, including:

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) 
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) 
c) perimeter 
d) area 
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) 
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) 
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) 
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) 
i) symmetry 
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

Overall, the results of this projects will indicate whether using machine learning has diagnostic benefits, and how they compare to modern diagnostic methods.
